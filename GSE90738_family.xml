5ug isolated total RNA was treated with Rnase R (Epicentre, Madison, WI) to remove linear RNA. cDNA labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) was produced by Eberwine’s linear RNA amplification method and subsequent enzymatic reaction41, and the procedure has been improved by using CapitalBio circRNA Amplification and Labeling Kit (CapitalBio, Beijing) for producing higher yields of labeled cDNA. In detail, double-stranded cDNAs (containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence) were synthesized from 0.2 μg total RNA using the CbcScript reverse transcriptase with cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Capitalbio, Beijing) with the T7 Oligo (dN). After completion of double-stranded cDNA (dsDNA) synthesis using DNA polymerase and RNase H, the dsDNA products about 12.5μL were subjected to 40μL in vitro transcription reactions at 37℃ for 14 h using a T7 Enzyme Mix. The amplified cRNA was purified using the RNA Clean-up Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany). Klenow enzyme labeling strategy was adopted after reverse transcription using reverse transcriptase. Labeled cDNA was purified with a PCR NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany) and re-suspended in elution buffer.

27.5 μL of labeled samples were dissolved in 82.5 μL hybridization solution containing 3×SSC, 0.2% SDS, 5×Denhardt’s solution and 25% formamide. DNA in hybridization solution was denatured at 95℃ for 3 min prior to loading onto a the CapitalBio circRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray V1.0 (4x90K, CapitalBio, Beijing). Arrays hybridization were performed in a Agilent Hybridization Oven overnight at a rotation speed of 20 rpm and a temperature of 42℃ and washed with two consecutive solutions (0.2% SDS, 2× SSC at 42℃ for 5 min, and 0.2× SSC for 5 min at room temperature).

    <Scan-Protocol>
After washing the slides, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2565CA (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Acquired array images were analyzed by Agilent Feature Extraction (v10.7) software.

    <Data-Processing>
Microarray data was extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software. Data summarization, quantile normalization, quality control and most of the subsequent data processing were executed using GeneSpring software V12.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) or R software package. Raw and processed files were filtered to remove lncRNA probes.

Microarray data was extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software. Data summarization, quantile normalization, quality control and most of the subsequent data processing were executed using GeneSpring software V12.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) or R software package. Raw and processed files were filtered to remove lncRNA probes.

5ug isolated total RNA was treated with Rnase R (Epicentre, Madison, WI) to remove linear RNA. cDNA labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) was produced by Eberwine’s linear RNA amplification method and subsequent enzymatic reaction41, and the procedure has been improved by using CapitalBio circRNA Amplification and Labeling Kit (CapitalBio, Beijing) for producing higher yields of labeled cDNA. In detail, double-stranded cDNAs (containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence) were synthesized from 0.2 μg total RNA using the CbcScript reverse transcriptase with cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Capitalbio, Beijing) with the T7 Oligo (dN). After completion of double-stranded cDNA (dsDNA) synthesis using DNA polymerase and RNase H, the dsDNA products about 12.5μL were subjected to 40μL in vitro transcription reactions at 37℃ for 14 h using a T7 Enzyme Mix. The amplified cRNA was purified using the RNA Clean-up Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany). Klenow enzyme labeling strategy was adopted after reverse transcription using reverse transcriptase. Labeled cDNA was purified with a PCR NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany) and re-suspended in elution buffer.

27.5 μL of labeled samples were dissolved in 82.5 μL hybridization solution containing 3×SSC, 0.2% SDS, 5×Denhardt’s solution and 25% formamide. DNA in hybridization solution was denatured at 95℃ for 3 min prior to loading onto a the CapitalBio circRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray V1.0 (4x90K, CapitalBio, Beijing). Arrays hybridization were performed in a Agilent Hybridization Oven overnight at a rotation speed of 20 rpm and a temperature of 42℃ and washed with two consecutive solutions (0.2% SDS, 2× SSC at 42℃ for 5 min, and 0.2× SSC for 5 min at room temperature).

The amplified cRNA was purified using the RNA Clean-up Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany). Klenow enzyme labeling strategy was adopted after reverse transcription using reverse transcriptase. Labeled cDNA was purified with a PCR NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (MACHEREY - NAGEL, Germany) and re-suspended in elution buffer.

    <Summary>
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous and regulatory non-coding RNAs, but their expressions in tumor and plasma are largely unknown. Here, our study firstly suggested that microarray should be more efficient than RNA sequencing for circRNA profiling. Then, we detected ~80,000 circRNAs expressed in cervical tumors and matched normal tissues by microarray, and ~23,000 of them are differently expressed. The numbers of up- and down-regulated circRNAs during tumorigenesis are almost equal. In addition, we discovered that the expression of different circRNA isoforms from the same linear RNA also different. Strikingly, as much as ~18,000 circRNAs could be robustly detected in plasmas, and ~8,000 circRNAs show different expression after surgery of tumor removal. Altogether, taking advantage of the huge number of circRNAs detected in tumor and plasma, we provide strong evidence for circRNA expression, regulation and potential clinical application as non-invasive biomarkers.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The circRNA expression in Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR, 2 replicated samples) was compared to circRNA expression in Ambion’s Human Brain Reference total RNA (HBRR, 2 replicated samples) from the Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) project; The circRNA expression in cervical tumor (10 samples) was compared to circRNA expression in adjacent normal tissue (control, 10 samples) of 10 patients; The mRNA expression in cervical tumor (10 samples) was compared to mRNA expression in adjacent normal tissue(control, 10 samples) of 10 patients; The circRNA expression in preoperative plasma samples (control,7 samples) was compared to circRNA expression in postoperative plasma samples (14 samples) of 8 out of 10 cervical cancer patients. Microarray based circRNA expression profiles were acquired using CapitalBio circRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray V1.0 screening for 87,935 distinct human circRNA candidates.
